At present, some of my favorite books include the Percy Jackson series as it has a lot to do with Ancient Mythology. It covers almost every region's mythology with some series or another, from Greek/Roman to Egyptian, to even Norse, but with a lighter, more kid-friendly story and easier accessbility to all. It's got representation of all kinds as well, and the author is well liked within his community.
