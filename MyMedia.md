At present, some of my favorite books include the Percy Jackson series as it has a lot to do with Ancient Mythology. It covers almost every region's mythology with some series or another, from Greek/Roman to Egyptian, to even Norse, but with a lighter, more kid-friendly story and easier accessbility to all. It's got representation of all kinds as well, and the author is well liked within his community.

### Favorite Media

This is a table about my favor media, why I recommnend it, and who created it.

| Item | Why | Author |
| :---: | :--- | :---: |
| PJO | As stated before, Percy Jackson it's amazing for getting into or re-experiencing mythology of almost any variety. | Rick Riordan |
| HP | Harry Potter is a wonderful series full of magic and fantasy, with plenty of content to dive into. | J.K. Rowling |
| SoI | The Series of Inheritance is an amazing, albeit slow-paced fantasy story about dragons, their riders, and what came to be of it all. Along the lines of The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings Trilogies with a little less meat on the bones. | Christopher Paolini
| LotR | The Lord of the Rings & the Hobbit trilogies are some of the best and most widely referenced fantasy books to date. Almost everything we see of fantasy stems from the world Tolkien made. | J. R. R. Tolkien
