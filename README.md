### HuHot Mongolian Grill
I like HuHot as it's an **all-you-can-eat buffet**. It's also one where not only do you picked the food/ingredients but also the sauce for a stir fry you watch cooked in front of you on an **open grill**. The food you can make is not only **delicious** but **unique to each time you go**.
