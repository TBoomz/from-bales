### HuHot Mongolian Grill
I like HuHot as it's an **all-you-can-eat buffet**. It's also one where not only do you picked the food/ingredients but also the sauce for a stir fry you watch cooked in front of you on an **open grill**. The food you can make is not only **delicious** but **unique to each time you go**.

### HuHot Favorite Dishes
Given the way the "meals" are made, dishes aren't given names but have different types. Here's some favorites in preference order:
1. Stir Fry
2. Noodle-Based Dishes
3. Rice-Based Dishes

There are other places to visit nearby such as:
- Scooter's Ice Cream
- Bonkers Playhouse
